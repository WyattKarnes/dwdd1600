            <p>
                When in the Course of human events, it <strong>becomes necessary</strong>
                for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,
                and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
                to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect 
                to opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
                them to the separation. Perchance.
